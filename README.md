## Local development env

This project uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation#installing-nx-globally)(a monorepo tool) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)(package manager), so it's recommended to install them globally.

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [here]() is a recommended profile you can directly use.

The overall process is: Setup mysql env -> Start backend -> Start frontend.

### Database

### Backend

```bash
nx serve api
```

### Frontend

```bash
nx dev web
```

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx dev web` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build web` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
